This section covers component reusability. We notice that in websites, a lot of the components are repeated,
so how can we store and nest them so that we don't have to rewrite code all the time?

-> We create a new file that to house these components, paste the JSX in it, and use a new concept:
    called "react props". These will be explored.


Video 33. We realised that it is super annoying to duplicate the comment code in the same file. Why not we allocate that to another component? 

Video 34. In this tutorial, we had code in index.js, that we cut and put under a const component called CommentDetail. This was the shift we made.
